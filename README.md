ATTENTION
---------
1. This is just a snapshot from the GIT repository and is **NOT A STABLE
version of Roundcube**. It's not recommended to replace an existing installation
of Roundcube with this version. Also using a separate database for this
installation is highly recommended.

2. This is a modified version by [THNIC foundation](https://xn--42cl2bj2hxbd2g.xn--12cfi8ixb8l.xn--o3cw4h/) to make a Roundcube Webmail can loging by using EAI (Email Address Internationalization) focus on Thai language. 

3. This is a proof of concept version (POC).

INTRODUCTION
------------
Roundcube Webmail is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an
application-like user interface. It provides full functionality you expect
from an email client, including MIME support, address book, folder management,
message searching and spell checking. Roundcube Webmail is written in PHP and
requires the MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite database. With its plugin API it is
easily extendable and the user interface is fully customizable using skins.

The code designed to run on a webserver is mainly written in PHP and Javascript.
It includes a custom framework with an IMAP library derived from [IlohaMail][iloha]
and requires a set of external libraries (see composer.json and jsdeps.json files).

THNIC Foundation forked and modified code to support login by [EAI email](https://xn--12cn4frcvb5f.xn--o3cw4h/%e0%b8%8a%e0%b8%b7%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%b5%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%a0%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a9%e0%b8%b2%e0%b9%84%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%a2-eai/)


INSTALLATION
------------

If you're updating an older version of Roundcube please follow the steps
described in the UPGRADING file.


BROWSER SUPPORT
---------------
Roundcube uses jQuery 3.x (and other libs) for its client and therefore
inherits the browser support from there. This currently includes:

- Chrome: (Current - 1) and Current
- Edge: (Current - 1) and Current
- Firefox: (Current - 1) and Current, ESR
- Internet Explorer: 11+
- Safari: (Current - 1) and Current
- Opera: Current

How to make Roundcube can login with EAI mail (MySQL method)
---------------
Roundcube Webmail is used by [THNIC foundation](https://xn--42cl2bj2hxbd2g.xn--12cfi8ixb8l.xn--o3cw4h/) and it is not UA-Ready (Universal Aceeptance) platform because it cannot use other languages email except English to login. Then, [THNIC foundation](https://xn--42cl2bj2hxbd2g.xn--12cfi8ixb8l.xn--o3cw4h/) modified it by query English email when THNIC fondation users used Thai email.

For example, ไทย@อีเอไอ.ไทย and thai@eai.in.th, the added function will find thai@eai.in.th and use it as username for login instead of อีเอไอ@คน.ไทย when users use Thai email to login.

The function named "map_users" is in index.php:

```
function map_users(&$auth){
  $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "your-db-user", "your-db-password", "your-database");
  if ($conn->connect_error) {
      error_log("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error,0);
  }
  //youremailmappingtable = the table that have record of your EAI mail and english email from $auth['user']
  $result = $conn->query("SELECT yourenglishemail FROM youremailmappingtable WHERE youreaiemail='".$auth['user']."'");
  if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
      $row = $result->fetch_row();
      $auth['user'] = $row['0'];
  }
}
map_users($auth);
```
Here the basic sql for create mapping email table:

```
CREATE TABLE youremailmappingtable (youreaiemail varchar(80) NOT NULL, yourenglishemail TEXT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (youreaiemail) ); 
INSERT INTO youremailmappingtable (youreaiemail,yourenglishemail) VALUES ('ไทย@อีเอไอ.ไทย','thai@eai.in.th');
```

Also we have modified 3 files to make Adress book and Sending EAI mail working:

1. rcmail_sendmail.php
2. rcube_utils.php
3. rcube_user.php

This is not the best solution yet. Please feel free to fork or modified this repositories.
